# Sling TODO

A TODO List application in the spirit of TODO MVC illustrating the basics of Sling based application development.

## Installation & Local Environment Setup

See the `master` branch README for Installation and Local Environment Setup instructions.
    
## Branch Details - variant/pureJsp

The Pure JSP branch demonstrates a ToDo application written using nothing other than jsps, the page context properties 
exposed by Sling, and the jsp tags contained in Sling. 

While this branch does not follow particularly good development practices it is a very concrete demonstration 
of the relationship between resource types and rendering / behavior in Sling.
